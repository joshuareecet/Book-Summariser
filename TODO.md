TODO (HIGH to LOW priority): 

0. What if the chapter is longer than a the context window - need to split chapter up multiple parts as well.

1. Tkinter making load time long - load only when necessary.

2. Finish the find and delete functions in the bookshelf.

1. Add exceptions for edge cases e.g:
    1.1 Book may not have any chapters at all? need to decide what to do here..
    1.2 User does not have an epub, cannot escape the while loop. Should allow the user to cancel.

2. Integrate with a book tracker
    5.1 Calibre - primary target

3. Create GUI interface 

4. Look into if sending the preivous chapter in addition to the current improves context for chapter summary
